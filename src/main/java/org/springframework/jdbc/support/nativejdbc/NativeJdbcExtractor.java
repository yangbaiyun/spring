/**
 * Interface for extracting native JDBC objects from wrapped objects coming from
 * connection pools. This is necessary to be able to case to native implementations
 * like OracleConnection or OracleResultSet in application code, for example to
 * create Blobs or access other vendor-specific features.
 *
 * <p>Note: Setting a custom NativeJdbcExtractor is just necessary if you want to
 * cast to database-specific implementations, like OracleConnection/OracleResultSet.
 * Else, any wrapped JDBC object will be fine too.
 *
 * <p>Note: To be able to support any pool's strategy of native ResultSet wrapping,
 * it is advisable to get both the native Statement <i>and</i> the native ResultSet
 * via this extractor. Some pools just allow to unwrap the Statement, some just to
 * unwrap the ResultSet - the above strategy will cover both. It is typically
 * <i>not</i> necessary to unwrap the Connection to retrieve the native ResultSet.
