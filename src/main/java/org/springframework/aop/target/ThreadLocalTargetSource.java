/**
 * Alternative to an object pool. This TargetSource uses a threading model in which
 * every thread has its own copy of the target. There's no contention for targets.
 * Target object creation is kept to a minimum on the running server.
 *
 * <p>Application code is written as to a normal pool; callers can't assume they
 * will be dealing with the same instance in invocations in different threads.
 * However, state can be relied on during the operations of a single thread:
 * for example, if one caller makes repeated calls on the AOP proxy.
 *
 * <p>Cleanup is performed in the destroy() method from DisposableBean.
