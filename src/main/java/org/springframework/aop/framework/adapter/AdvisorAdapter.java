 * Interface allowing extension to the Spring AOP framework to allow

 * Implementing objects can wrap Advice objects in an Advisor,

 * for use in the Spring AOP framework.
 * <br>Typically an implementation will understand an Advice type
 * and the matching AdvisorWrapper: e.g. MethodBeforeAdvice and BeforeAdvisor.
 * <br>There is no need for most Spring users to implement this interface;
 * do so only if you need to introduce more Advisor or Advice types to
