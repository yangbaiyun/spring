 * MVC View for a web interaction. Implementations are responsible for rendering
 * content, and exposing the model. A single view exposes multiple model attributes.
 *
 * <p>This class and the MVC approach associated with it is discussed in Chapter 12 of
 * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0764543857/">Expert One-On-One J2EE Design and Development</a>
 * by Rod Johnson (Wrox, 2002).
 *
 * <p>View implementations may differ widely. An obvious implementation would be
 * JSP-based. Other implementations might be XSLT based, or use an HTML generationlibrary.
 * This interface is designed to avoid restricting the range of possible implementations.
 *
 * <p>Views should be beans. They are likely to be instantiated as beans by a ViewResolver.
 * As this interface is stateless, view implementations should be thread-safe.
