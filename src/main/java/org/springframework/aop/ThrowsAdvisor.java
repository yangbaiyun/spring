/**
 * Advisor that delivers <b>throws</b> advice.
 * Such advice is targeted by a pointcut.
 * Throws advice is less general than around advice. Anything that
 * can be done with throws advice can be done with around advice.
 * However, there is still value in offering throws advice, as it
 * provides a simpler programming model (no need to invoke the next
 * in a chain of interceptors); and strong typing for exceptions.
 * <br>
 * A throws advice object should implement methods of the form:
 * afterThrowing([Method], [args], [target], Throwable subclass) 
 * The first three arguments are optional, and only useful if
 * we want further information about the joinpoint, as in AspectJ
 * <b>after throwing</b> advice.
 * The advisor re-raises the exception when it's done.
