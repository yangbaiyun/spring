/** 
 * Interface to provide configuration for an application.
 * This is read-only while the application is running,
 * but may be reloaded if the implementation supports this.
 *
 * <p>The configuration provides:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The ability to resolve messages, supporting internationalization.
 * <li>The ability to publish events. Implementations must provide a means
 * of registering event listeners.
 * <li>Bean factory methods, inherited from ListableBeanFactory. This
 * avoids the need for applications to use singletons.
 * <li>Notification of beans initialized by the context of the context,
 * enabling communication with the rest of the application, for
 * example by publishing events. The BeanFactory superinterface
 * provides no similar mechanism.
 * <li>Inheritance from a parent context. Definitions in a descendant context
 * will always take priority. This means, for example, that a single parent
 * context can be used by an entire web application, while each servlet has its
 * own child context that is independent of that of any other servlet.
 * </ul>
